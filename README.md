# Workday Scheduler
This is an application where the user can fill out and save timeblocks corresponding to hours of a common workday.

### Features
The color of the text section of each timeblock changes along with the current time of day. Green if in the future, red if in the current hour, and grey if in the past. When a save button is clicked, the text for the corresponding timeblock is saved to local storage, and persists upon refreshing the page.
